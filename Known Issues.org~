* Known Issues
** Web Client
   - File Tree doesn't update after a change has been made. The user has to click the 
     Get Files button everytime a document is created or deleted.
   - Since the File Tree doesn't update itself it won't remove it self either. Clicking
     the Get Files button won't remove the existing File Tree but makes a new one. 
     The old one can then be ignored.
