* Definition of done
Before our system is ready for release, we must have implemented all required features.
In addition to implementing the features, we also must document every aspect of the system
and the process. This includes diagrams, use cases etc ...
Finally we have to test our system to make sure that it works as intended and doesn't break 
when receiving odd input etc..

A more detailed explanation of the requirements can be found below.


** Development
The system must be able to handle all the requirements before it can be deemed done.
These requirements include the assignment required requirements as well as our
own requirements.

These requirements include:
   - [ ] Document [0/4]
     - [ ] Create a document that can handle both text and images.
     - [ ] Documents can be arranged into folders.
     - [ ] Documents can be arranged into projects (optional).
     - [ ] Log of all changes to a document.
   - [ ] System [0/4]
     - [ ] Synchronization for offline usage.
     - [ ] Sharing of documents to other users.
     - [ ] Authentication system for users.
     - [ ] Document storage in a database.
   - [ ] User Interface [0/2]
     - [ ] Web interface.
     - [ ] Stand-alone client (for offline usage).


** Documentation
All aspects of the system must be documented.
The idea of the documentation is that the system is easy to understand based only on
the documentation. In addition, an external actor must be able to see the development
process from reading the documentation only.

These documents must be made before the documentation can be deemed as done:
   - [ ] Use cases [0/3]
     - [ ] All use cases must be documented (text form)
     - [ ] Use case diagram must be made for use cases that require it.
     - [ ] Operation contracts must be made for use cases that are complex.
   - [ ] Domain documentation [0/2]
     - [ ] A model must be made for describing the domain.
     - [ ] A sequence diagram must be made for understanding how to domain
       interacts.
   - [ ] Software documentation [0/4]
     - [ ] Static class diagram that explains the entire system.
     - [ ] Package diagram that shows a higher view of the system.
     - [ ] Interaction diagrams that describe the dynamic aspect of the system.
     - [ ] E-R diagram for the database structure.

** Testing
Before the system can be declared done, all the core features of the system
must be thoroughly tested.
This includes testing all core features of the system.

Testing checklist:
   - [ ] System [0/8]
     - [ ] Document
     - [ ] DocumentHandler
     - [ ] Folder
     - [ ] User
     - [ ] UserAuth
     - [ ] DBConnector
     - [ ] ClientSystemFacade
     - [ ] ServerSystemFacade
   - [ ] Client [0/2]
     - [ ] Stand-Aloone client
     - [ ] Web-Client
