Tehnical Memo
Issue: Choosing how to connect to the database

Solution Summary: Simplest option due to time pressure

Factors
- Simplicity
- Easy to get working

Solution:
Our way of connecting to the database, and executing queries on it is a series
of methods close to hardcoded SQL queries. they do not automatically update if a 
table/collumn/attribute were to change.

Motivation:
Early in the process we also designed a solid design for the database, which ment
that we were able to make the "final" outcast of the database rather quickly.

And looking apart from the fact that the solution does not adapt to changes made on 
the database, it works perfectly and requireded minimal attention and time to get working.

Alternatives considered:
Entity framework was a possability from the start, but since entity framework had prooven 
a challenge to get working for all of us in the past, we choose the, for us at the time,
simpler solution to save time in the end
