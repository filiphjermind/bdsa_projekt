- Creating files in the "root-root" folder if no folder is selected, the 
"create document" method creates a document in a folder that should not 
be accessable at all

- "update settings" creates new directory, even if user does not exist.
When calling the method, it takes the "username" and creates a new folder 
in currently selected directory

- no way to log in on the standalone client, if your credentials are in the 
"username" and "password" textboxes, this is considdered logging in.

- when syncing, the document will not be successfull synched the first time
and the user will not be told when is is done, only the server can see if the
documents have been successfully synched.

- When Synchonizing files that does not yet exist on the server, the server needs time 
to create the files, this blocks the client from recieving the files, this results in
the client only getting existing documents on server back.

- syncronize() should return a bool, describing wehter the sync was successfull or not
most times when not successful it is because og above problem
