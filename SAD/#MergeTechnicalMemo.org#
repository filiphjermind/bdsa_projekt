* Technical Memo
** Issue: 
   - Merging two versions of the same document.
** Solution Summary:
   - Git-hub inspired merge.
** Factors:
   - Merging two versions of the same document without overwriting existing changes.
** Solution:
   Our merging algorithm reads the two documents and stores them, line by line in
   an array.
   Then the algorithm compares each line in the two arrays, if the lines are the same, 
   insert the line into a new array. If the two lines aren't identical, insert the new line
   into the new array + insert the line from the old array in the next line. This line will
   be encapsulated with <<< TEXT >>> which shows the user where there is a conflict which
   the user can solve later on.
   If the new version of the document contains lines that aren't in the old array, they are 
   simply added to the new array.
** Motivation:
   There are other, more advanced, merging algorithms available. Because of time constraint
   we chose to use this one. It isn't the most advanced/complete algorithm but it does the
   job quite well considered it's simplicity.
** Unresolved issues:
   - Our algorithm doesn't 100% solve the conflict. In the end the user must manually chose which
     version to keep, and which version to discard.
   - If two identical lines exists in both versions but the lines is at another line number in the old
     document, this might cause a conflict (<<< TEXT >>>) that could be avoided.
** Alternatives considered:
   An algorithm that analyses every line in the file keeps the one that the user wants.
